The 6DOF Motion Platform will be built with low-cost materials, with a portable design that is resistant to transportation. The mobile or delicate parts must be protected so that they are manipulated by children 10 years of age and older.

The 6DOF Motion Platform will connect with a flight simulator to imitate the flight attitude of the aircraft.

It will have a LCD screen with a keyboard to change the modes of operation. It will be integrated with a voice assistant like Alexa to switch modes of operation in the same way.
