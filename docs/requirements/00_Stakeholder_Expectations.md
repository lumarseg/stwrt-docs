THIS DOCUMENT IS PART OF THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION PROCESS (TRDP), THAT TRANSFORMS THE STAKEHOLDERS EXPECTATIONS INTO A DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM AND THEN INTO A COMPLETE SET OF VALIDATED TECHNICAL REQUEREMENTS EXPRESSED AS "SHALL" STATEMENTS. THE GOAL OF THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT DEFINITION PROCESS IS THE DEFINITION AND DESING OF SOLUTIONS FOR THE END PRODUCT BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE (EPBS).

## 1. Introduction

A 6DOF Motion Platform (also known as Stewart Platform), is a type of parallel manipulator that has six prismatic actuators, commonly hydraulic jacks or electric linear actuators, attached in pairs to three positions on the platform's baseplate, crossing over to three mounting points on a top plate. Devices placed on the top plate can be moved in the six degrees of freedom in which it is possible for a freely-suspended body to move: Three linear movements and three rotations.

The Stewart platform design is extensively used in flight simulators, particularly in the full flight simulator which requires all 6 degrees of freedom.

## 2. Scope

Design and build a 6DOF Motion Platform, using Arcadia's MBSE methodology and the Capella tool. Additionally, good practices described in "NASA System Engineering Handbook", "INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook A Guide for System Life Cycle Processes and Activities" and "Model-Based Requirements Engineering" will be taken as a reference.

## 3. Stakeholder Expectations

### 3.1 Sponsor

The 6DOF Motion Platform will be built with low-cost materials, with a portable design that is resistant to transportation. The mobile or delicate parts must be protected so that they are manipulated by children 10 years of age and older.

The 6DOF Motion Platform will connect with a flight simulator to imitate the flight attitude of the aircraft.

It will have a LCD screen with a keyboard to change the modes of operation. It will be integrated with a voice assistant like Alexa to switch modes of operation in the same way. It will have visual and sound indications, and interfaces to peripherals such as an external keyboard or joystick.
